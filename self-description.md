# Self Description

I am a student studying automation at Tsinghua University. I am curious about the world, and I like to explore all kinds of possibilities through programming. Below I will describe what interesting things I have tried in a few short paragraphs.

C/C++ was the first programming language I learned and the one I use most often. [EasyTranslation](https://github.com/weixr18/EasyTranslation) was my first "big" project. With the help of the Qt framework, I implemented a simple system for adding, deleting, and checking data with a graphical interface. It was very rudimentary, using a MySQL backend and no network connection, but I got familiar with the basic object-oriented development specifications through it.

In [CUDA-Test](https://github.com/weixr18/CUDA-Test), I tried to write a simple parallel program for matrix multiplication using CUDA. In [W-Chatroom](https://github.com/weixr18/W-Chatroom) I explored simple network communication in concurrent mode with the help of winsock2 and pthread. [Euler-method](https://github.com/weixr18/Euler-method) performed a numerical simulation of a nonlinear ordinary differential equation (SEIR model of infectious disease propagation) by Euler method using a high precision floating point library gmp. [Virus-Spread](https://github.com/weixr18/Virus-Spread), on the other hand, used discrete time simulation to simulated the spread of viruses under different initial conditions and visualized it using pyqt.

Besides C/C++, the programming language I used most often was python, which I used to explore many deep learning and image processing related projects. [MNIST-pytorch](https://github.com/weixr18/MNIST-pytorch) compared the performance of some small neural networks on some smaller datasets. [CellSegmentation](https://github.com/weixr18/EasyTranslation) and [CIFAR-Classify](https://github.com/weixr18/CIFAR-Classify) solved specific PythonMLExercise provides code for some simple machine learning algorithms. [Numeric-SI](https://github.com/weixr18/Mumeric-SI) is an attempt to simulate SI models of infectious diseases using Euler's method. Finally, [DigitalImages](https://github.com/weixr18/DigitalImages) is an algorithm that uses opencv-python to solve some traditional image processing problems.

I also explored a lot of interesting things. [MyPushBox](https://github.com/weixr18/MyPushBox) is a project using .NET and C# that builds a simple environment for a pushbox game and implements a search algorithm based AI. [Xiniture](https://github.com/weixr18/Ximiture) is a small web project that implements front-end and back-end using Vue and django respectively. [SingleCycleCPU](https://github.com/weixr18/SingleCycleCPU) provides a simplified implementation of a single-cycle MIPS architecture CPU. [BLE-Glow-Hockey](https://github.com/weixr18/BLE-Glow-Hockey) is a hybrid project that involves both simple Android app development and C development on embedded devices, as well as FPGA-specific architecture building using the hardware description language verilog.

I will not be satisfied with what I have explored, because there is still a vast area I haven't yet had a glimpse. I already know how to build and design simple analog and digital circuits, so embedded devices are very interesting directions. I might look into running real-time systems and Linux systems on embedded devices, or Raspberry Pi to build my own simple server to run netbooks, file transfers across devices, git services, etc. Control is my major course and thus a very interesting direction to explore. I might explore running certain control algorithms on MCUs to control the movement of something.

I know that there are many more things I can explore in the world of code, computing and electronics. I will always be hungry and foolish and look forward to new adventures.
