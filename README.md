## Star Projects

### MLAN

[MLAN](https://github.com/weixr18/MLAN) is a Machine Learning algorithm organizing project (Chinese) that contains 66 important algorithms for 34 machine learning models, listing the computational procedures and derivations of these algorithms. 

### Pi-SLAM

[Pi-SLAM](https://github.com/weixr18/Pi-SLAM) is my undergraduate degree final project. It is a complete active monocular vision SLAM system that drives a Raspberry Pi + monocular camera omnidirectional cart, and the code is based on ORB-SLAM2.

## AI tools

### Paper-Reader

[Paper-Reader](https://github.com/weixr18/Paper-Reader) is a small tool for batch summarization of papers by calling LLM through API, which can be used for batch extraction of key information, etc.

### Chat-Analysis

[Chat-Analysis](https://github.com/weixr18/Chat-Analysis) is a small tool for statistics and analysis of group chat records, supporting topic summarization through LLM API.

## Course Projects

### Single-Cycle CPU

[SingleCycleCPU](https://github.com/weixr18/SingleCycleCPU) is a MIPS architrcture CPU inplemented in Verilog. Only support a few machine instructions.

### BLE-Glow-Hockey

[BLE-Glow-Hockey](https://github.com/weixr18/BLE-Glow-Hockey): this assignment for the electronic design course is a classic hockey mobile game. However, the server runs on an embedded device and uses the accelerometer to sense the device's tilt, thereby adding a consistent tilted ground effect in the game. It also supports picking up colors from the real world as the player's color.
